# Dart Crash Course

This is a comprehensive Dart crash course designed to help you learn the Dart programming language quickly and effectively.

## What is Dart?

Dart is a programming language designed for building web, server, and mobile applications. It is developed by Google and is the primary language used for building applications with the Flutter framework.

- In essence, it is a language used to make **multi-platform** applications.

- Dart is a **statically typed language**, meaning that every variable must have it's own type. These variable types are known at compile time. This allows for better performance and error checking compared to dynamically typed languages like JavaScript.

Also once a variable is declared and assigned to a datatype, it cannot be changed to a different type. This is known as **strong typing**.

Example:

```dart
var a = 5;
a = "Hello"; // This will throw an error
```
